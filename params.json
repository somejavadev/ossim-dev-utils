  "body": "  \r\n### About:     \r\nThis project was written purely to assist with the creation of ossim rule based plugins. The project currently exists out of an Angular / Bootstrap front end which calls a very basic and lightweight PHP REST service to pull data out of an existing ossim installation. To use this web app you will need to be able to login to your ossim installation via SSH.     \r\n     \r\n### Installation:    \r\nTo install this web app, simply download the project structure and copy the web folder to your ossim apache directory.   \r\nCurrently the apache directory would be at: /var/www/     \r\nCopy the projects web directory here: /var/www/web          \r\nOnce you have done this you can open up your browser and visit the ossim admin URL in the following format: https://x.x.x.x/web/frontend/index.html (this will bring you to the dev utilities page).     \r\n\r\nCurrently you do not need to specify a username or password for the utility to access the ossim database, the app will read these values from ossim's config in: /etc/ossim/ossim_setup.conf       \r\n        \r\n### **Disclaimer:**    \r\nThis web app is not affiliated with, nor is it an official app of [AlienVault](https://www.alienvault.com/)     \r\nUsage of this app is at your own risk.   \r\n",
